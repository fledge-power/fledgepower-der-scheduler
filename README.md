# fledgepower-der-scheduler
IEC-scheduling (or DER-scheduling) is a specific form of scheduling with a lot of properties that should not be confused with any generic scheduling such also as in IT

This project implements an IEC 61850 server/north plugin for fledgepower. Its main purpose is to implement a DER scheduler.


# Building and running

## Manually building libiec61850

To install the dependencies you can run the requirements.sh script.

If you want to install them manually :

To build IEC61850 C/C++ North plugin, you need to download lib61850 at:
https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mz-automation/libiec61850.git
$ cd libiec61850
$ export LIB_IEC61850=`pwd`
```
As shown above, you need a $LIB_IEC61850 env var set to the source tree of the
library.

Then, you can build libiec61850 with:

```bash
$ cd libiec61850
$ cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=NO -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=NO ..
$ make
$ sudo make install
$ sudo ldconfig
```

If you want scheduling support also, you can add the der-scheduling library as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir -p dependencies
$ cd dependencies
$ echo Fetching iec61850 scheduler library
$ git clone -b develop_mz git@github.com:alliander-opensource/der-scheduling.git
$ mv alliander-ise-iec-61850-scheduler der-scheduling
$ cd der-scheduling
```

Build
-----


To build the iec61850 plugin, once you are in the plugin source tree you need to run:

To build a release:

```bash 
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
$ make
```

To build with unit tests and code coverage:

```bash
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Coverage ..
$ make
```

- By default the Fledge develop package header files and libraries
  are expected to be located in /usr/include/fledge and /usr/lib/fledge
- If **FLEDGE_ROOT** env var is set and no -D options are set,
  the header files and libraries paths are pulled from the ones under the
  FLEDGE_ROOT directory.
  Please note that you must first run 'make' in the FLEDGE_ROOT directory.

You may also pass one or more of the following options to cmake to override
this default behaviour:

- **FLEDGE_SRC** sets the path of a Fledge source tree
- **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** sets the path to Fledge header files
- **FLEDGE_LIB sets** the path to Fledge libraries
- **FLEDGE_INSTALL** sets the installation path of Random plugin

NOTE:
- The **FLEDGE_INCLUDE** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
  header files have been installed in a single directory.
- The **FLEDGE_LIB** option should point to a location where all the Fledge
  libraries have been installed in a single directory.
- 'make install' target is defined only when **FLEDGE_INSTALL** is set

Examples:

- no options

  $ cmake ..

- no options and FLEDGE_ROOT set

  $ export FLEDGE_ROOT=/some_fledge_setup

  $ cmake ..

- set FLEDGE_SRC

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_SRC=/home/source/develop/Fledge  ..

- set FLEDGE_INCLUDE

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INCLUDE=/dev-package/include ..
- set FLEDGE_LIB

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_LIB=/home/dev/package/lib ..
- set FLEDGE_INSTALL

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/home/source/develop/Fledge ..

  $ cmake -DFLEDGE_INSTALL=/usr/local/fledge ..


Using the plugin
----------------

As described in the Fledge documentation, you can use the plugin by adding
a service from a terminal, or from the web API.C

1 - Add the service from a terminal:

.. code-block:: console

$ curl -sX POST http://localhost:8081/fledge/scheduled/task -d '{"name": "iec61850","plugin": "iec104","type": "north","schedule_type": 3,"schedule_day": 0,"schedule_time": 0,"schedule_repeat": 30,"schedule_enabled": true}' ; echo

Or

2) Add the service from the web GUI:

- On the web GUI, go to the North tab
- Click on "Add +"
- Select iec104 and give it a name, then click on "Next"
- Change the default settings to your settings, then click on "Next"
- Let the "Enabled" option checked, then click on "Done"
